# Crypto & Encoding Toolkit

## Description
A professional utility suite enabling LLMs to strictly perform deterministic cryptographic operations, encoding, and unique identifier generation without hallucinations.

## Parameters
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "operation": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["base64_encode", "base64_decode", "md5", "sha256", "uuid_v4"],
      "description": "The specific cryptographic or encoding operation to perform."
    },
    "data": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The input string data to process. Leave empty if operation is 'uuid_v4'."
    }
  },
  "required": ["operation"]
}
```

## Setup Instructions
No setup or API key is required. This is a native UniSkill engine powered by high-performance edge runtime.

## Implementation YAML
