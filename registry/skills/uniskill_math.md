# Uniskill Math Engine

## Description
A highly accurate scientific calculation engine that evaluates complex mathematical expressions. Use this to bypass LLM hallucination on arithmetic and algebraic logic.
* **100% Zero Hallucination** calculations.
* Perfect for financial, engineering, or structural queries.

## Parameters
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "expr": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The mathematical expression to evaluate. Supports basic operators (+, -, *, /) as well as complex functions (e.g., '1.2 * (2 + 4.5)', '5.08 cm to inch', 'sin(45 deg) ^ 2')."
    }
  },
  "required": ["expr"]
}
```
